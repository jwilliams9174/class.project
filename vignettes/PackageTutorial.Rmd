# An Introduction to My R Package
### A bit smaller

My R package is very **useful** and it does _three_ things.
We can go on to a new line.

This shall be a new paragraph.

## Installation Instructions
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("phytools")
# But if you include text in a code chunk, it must be commented
```

We can include text anywhere in the document.

![Caption](path/to/image)

It is possible to include [hyperlinks](wright-lab.org).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
